LongTris-3DO
=================

LongTris is a tetris clone for 3DO, based on SDLBlocks using the Gameblabla's Wrapper.
It still has some issues, the blocks are flickering when a lot of them are on-screen
The goal is to the definitive tetris clone for the 3DO video game console.

I'm no longer working on this btw so feel free to fork it.
This should be using software rendering to CELs instead of using the pixel drawing routines like that.

CONTROLS
============
A : Drop
Up : Turn
Left/Right : Move block
