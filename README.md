LongTris-3DO
=================

LongTris is a tetris clone for 3DO, based on SDLBlocks using the Gameblabla's Wrapper.
Last time i tried, it had issues on 3DO but it may work now.
It still has plenty of issues though, especially with optimisations turned on.
The goal is to the definitive tetris clone for the 3DO video game console.
